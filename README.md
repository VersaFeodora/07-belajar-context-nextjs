### Practicum 1
1. ![Screenshot](README-pic/1a.png)<br/>
Several text will appears from the webpage. Although there is no notable difference, these texts are divided into 4 nested sections. By using this method, we could combine several components into one.<br/>

As mentioned above, the layout stays the same. However, there is chance that error `failed to compile` will appear. This is caused by the usage of LevelContext that requires client components. Because of this, simply add `'use client'` in `main_page.tsx` will solve the issue<br/>

As mentioned above, the layout stays the same, with the only difference is there is no usage of level parameter in each section.<br/>
